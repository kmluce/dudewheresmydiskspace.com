    <h1 style=" text-align: center;"><b>Dude, Where's My Disk Space?</b></h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> or, <b>Girl You'd Better fsck it Before You
        Wreck It</b></p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">We've all been there.&nbsp; Your linux (or
      other unix) disk partition is way full and you can't figure out what
      happened to the disk space.&nbsp; Maybe you had a download going and you
      stopped it, but the disk didn't get any less full.&nbsp; Maybe you deleted
      some banananpants large log files, but the disk didn't get any less
      full!&nbsp; Worse, when you try to use du and df to figure out where your
      disk space went, the two don't even agree on how much disk space is used.<b><br>
      </b></p>
    <h1 style=" text-align: center;"><b><span style="color: red;">Don't Panic!</span></b></h1>
    <h3 style="  text-align: left;"><b>What's going on?</b></h3>
    <p>You have a file that has been deleted but hasn't been removed from the
      filesystem, because a running process is still holding a file handle for
      the file.&nbsp; Until the process releases the file handle, the disk space
      will continue to be used, and the process may still write to the file.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Why is it doing this?</h3>
    <p>Linux doesn't free up the space in a deleted file while any process has
      the file open; it just removes it from the directory.&nbsp; du traverses
      the directory tree to see what files exist within it, while df produces a
      filesystem-based -- as opposed to directory tree-based -- accounting of
      the amount of free space.&nbsp; df is therefore the more accurate view.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3>What can I do about it?</h3>
    <p>No worries, linux has you covered with lsof, the command to list open
      files.&nbsp; A simple lsof &lt;filesystem&gt; -- for example, <code>lsof
        /</code> --&nbsp; should give you a list of open files and tell you the
      process ID of whatever is using the file.&nbsp; Most versions will tag
      deleted files with '(deleted)' at the end of the line, so you can grep for
      that.&nbsp; After you've figured out what process is using the file, you
      can figure out how to stop and optionally restart the process, which
      should clear the disk space.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3>OMG, I can't kill that process; it's too important!</h3>
    <p>This is a bit trickier, but it's still generally doable to truncate the
      data out of the file.&nbsp; However, here you're getting into some risk
      that the process actually needs the data in the file.&nbsp; Think twice or
      three times before you do this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>using that process ID you got from lsof in the steps above, check your
        /proc for file descriptors.&nbsp; They're probably in
        /proc/&lt;process_id&gt;/fd</li>
      <li>if you do an <code>ls -l</code>, one of those file descriptor links
        will be broken or will note that it's to a deleted file</li>
      <li>once you've figured out which file descriptor, you can redirect
        nothing to it.&nbsp; For example, if my process is 13929 and my file
        descriptor is 4, I could do&nbsp; <code>&gt; /proc/13929/fd/4&nbsp;</code>
        to truncate the file.</li>
      <li>if you pick the wrong file descriptor, you're likely to be very, very
        boned.</li>
    </ol>
